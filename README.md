The game will consist of three different screens/views.

1. The landing page will tell the user what this application does.
2. The explore page will allow the user to discover the different APIs available.
3. The compare page will allow the user to shortlist and compare the different APIs.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to be able to view the different APIs by categories.
2. As a user, I want to be able to do a search to quickly narrow down my options.
3. As a user, I want to be able to filter by authentication so that I know which APIs are public.
4. As a user, I want to be able to shortlist a few selected APIs and compare them.
5. As a user, I want to be able to know what data the API will be able to provide.
